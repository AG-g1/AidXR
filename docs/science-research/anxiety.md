# VR for Anxiety — Peer-Reviewed Research

## Summary

VR exposure therapy (VRET) matches the gold standard of in-vivo exposure therapy, with effects that sustain and even increase over time. VRET combined with CBT shows larger effect sizes than either alone. Children and adolescents find VR-based approaches far more approachable than traditional exposure.

## Studies

### 1. VRET for Social Anxiety Disorder: Meta-Analysis

- **Year:** 2024
- **Journal:** Anxiety, Stress & Coping (Taylor & Francis)
- **Key Finding:** Large effect sizes for VRET vs. waitlist: Hedges' g = -0.86 at post-intervention, -1.03 at 3-month follow-up, -1.14 at 6-month follow-up. No significant difference between VRET and in-vivo exposure — comparable efficacy. Benefits sustained and increased over time.
