# VR for Autism / ASD — Peer-Reviewed Research

## Summary

VR creates safe, repeatable social environments where children with ASD can practice eye contact, emotion recognition, and conversational skills. Meta-analyses show clinically significant improvements in social, emotional, and cognitive skills. Long-term, high-frequency interventions (6-15 weeks, 2-3 sessions/week) demonstrate the most effectiveness.

## Studies

### 1. Immersive VR-Based Training on Cognitive, Social, and Emotional Skills in ASD

- **Year:** 2024
- **Journal:** Research in Developmental Disabilities
- **Scope:** Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials
- **Key Finding:** Significant improvements in social skills (SMD = 1.43; 95% CI: 0.01-2.84; p = 0.05), emotional skills (SMD = 2.45; 95% CI: 0.21-4.18; p = 0.03), and cognitive skills. High-functioning autism benefited more than low-functioning.

### 2. VR Interventions for Social Skills in ASD

- **Authors:** Tong et al.
- **Year:** 2025
- **Journal:** Journal of Medical Internet Research (JMIR)
- **Key Finding:** Systematic review confirming VR positively impacts complex social skills including eye contact, emotion recognition, empathy, and conversational abilities.

### 3. VR and Emotion Regulation in ASD: Randomized Controlled Trial

- **Year:** 2024
- **Scope:** 40 boys with ASD aged 7-10
- **Key Finding:** Significant difference (p < 0.05) between VR intervention and control groups in executive functions and emotion regulation ability.

### 4. VR Enhances Cognitive and Social Communication in ASD

- **Year:** 2022
- **Journal:** Frontiers in Public Health
- **Scope:** 44 children with autism, 3-month intervention
- **Key Finding:** Both groups improved, but VR intervention group showed significantly better results in cognition and social interaction (p < 0.05).

## FDA Milestone

**Floreo VR** (2023) — First VR autism technology to receive FDA Breakthrough Device Designation. Also accepted into the FDA's Total Product Life Cycle Advisory Program (TAP). Pre-pivotal RCT comparing Floreo to sham VR showed clinically meaningful improvements in social communication behaviors over 12 weeks (Autism Impact Measure). Research partners: Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and NIH. Multi-site pivotal trial underway. Tennessee expanded Medicaid access to VR-based therapy through Floreo.
