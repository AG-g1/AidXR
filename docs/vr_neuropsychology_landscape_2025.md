# Virtual reality in neuropsychology: the clinical landscape in 2025

**VR has crossed from experimental novelty into regulated clinical tool in neuropsychology.** As of early 2026, at least eight VR-specific devices hold FDA clearance for neurological assessment, rehabilitation, or pain management — and the evidence base now includes Cochrane reviews of 109+ trials, sham-controlled RCTs with over 1,000 participants, and meta-analyses spanning thousands of patients. Yet the field remains uneven: exposure therapy and stroke rehabilitation rest on strong evidence, while cognitive assessment tools and TBI-specific applications are still maturing. This report maps the full landscape — regulatory milestones, clinical applications, key companies, and the positioning of specific products like Upgrade VR — to provide a grounded context for anyone building in this space.

## Eight FDA-cleared VR devices define the regulatory frontier

The FDA's creation of a dedicated product classification for VR therapy in 2021 was a watershed moment. When AppliedVR's **RelieVRx** (formerly EaseVRx) received De Novo authorization (DEN210014, November 2021), the agency established product code QRA — "Virtual Reality Behavioral Therapy Device for Pain Relief" — opening a regulatory pathway that subsequent devices have followed. CMS reinforced this in April 2023 by creating HCPCS code **E1905** for VR cognitive behavioral therapy devices, classifying them as Durable Medical Equipment eligible for Medicare reimbursement.

The following table captures every VR or VR-headset-based device with FDA clearance relevant to neuropsychology and adjacent fields:

| Device | Company | Authorization | Number | Date | Indication |
|--------|---------|--------------|--------|------|------------|
| **RelieVRx** | AppliedVR (Los Angeles, CA) | De Novo + 510(k) | DEN210014; K243417; K251519 | Nov 2021; Dec 2024; 2025 | Chronic lower back pain (VR-based CBT) |
| **VRNT** | CognifiSense (Silicon Valley, CA) | 510(k) | K230814 | Oct 2023 | Chronic pain (VR neuropsychological therapy) |
| **Smileyscope** | Smileyscope (Washington, DC / Melbourne) | 510(k) | K230825 | Sep 2023 | Acute procedural pain and anxiety in children |
| **Luminopia One** | Luminopia (Cambridge, MA) | De Novo + 510(k) | DEN210005; K221659 | Oct 2021; Nov 2022; Apr 2025 | Amblyopia (neuro-visual disorder) in children |
| **EYE-SYNC** | SyncThink/NeuroSync (Palo Alto, CA) | 510(k) + Breakthrough | K202927 | Mar 2016; Oct 2021 | Concussion/mTBI diagnosis via VR eye tracking |
| **REAL Immersive System** | Penumbra (Alameda, CA) | 510(k) | K183296 | Mar 2019 | Upper extremity rehab for stroke, CP, neurodegenerative disease |
| **MindMotionPRO** | MindMaze (Lausanne, Switzerland) | 510(k) | K162748 | Apr 2017 | Upper-limb neurorehabilitation post-stroke/TBI |
| **MindMotion GO** | MindMaze (Lausanne, Switzerland) | 510(k) | K173931 | 2018 | Mobile neurorehabilitation for outpatient/home |

Two important VR-adjacent devices also hold FDA authorization for neuropsychological conditions, though they use tablets rather than headsets: **EndeavorRx** (Akili Interactive; De Novo DEN200026, June 2020) and **EndeavorOTC** (De Novo, June 2024), both targeting attention function in ADHD through game-based digital therapeutics. Akili's STARS-ADHD pivotal trial (348 children, published in *Lancet Digital Health*) made EndeavorRx the first-ever FDA-authorized game-based therapeutic.

A critical regulatory distinction: **XRHealth**, one of the most prominent VR therapy platforms, describes itself as "FDA-registered" and markets under the E1905 DME code, but no specific 510(k) clearance number exists for its device. "Registered" and "cleared" are meaningfully different regulatory statuses. No VR device has yet received FDA clearance specifically for PTSD, anxiety disorders, depression, or schizophrenia — though several companies are actively pursuing these indications.

## How neuropsychologists are using VR across seven clinical domains

### Cognitive assessment is gaining ecological validity but lacks standardization

VR-based neuropsychological assessment aims to solve a fundamental limitation of traditional testing: ecological validity. Asking a patient to repeat digit spans in a quiet office tells clinicians something about working memory, but little about how that person functions in a busy kitchen or a noisy classroom. VR environments bridge this gap.

The **Nesplora platform** (Spain) leads this space with a suite of validated tools. **Nesplora AULA** places children aged 6–16 in a virtual classroom to measure attentional processes, with distractors the clinician can control — and uniquely tracks head motor activity via the headset's sensors. **Nesplora Aquarium** extends attention assessment to adults (15+), while **Nesplora Ice Cream** and **Suite Test** measure executive functions and visual memory respectively. AULA has demonstrated convergent validity with the Conners CPT across all measured variables.

More experimental tools include **CAVIRE** (Cognitive Assessment using Virtual Reality), which assessed all six cognitive domains in a 109-participant case-control study of older adults in Singapore (Tan et al., 2024, *Alzheimer's & Dementia: Diagnosis, Assessment & Disease Monitoring*), and **CAVIR**, an immersive VR kitchen scenario that differentiated patients with mood and psychosis-spectrum disorders from controls with large effect sizes (ηp² = 0.14–0.19).

A 2024 systematic review by Mancuso et al. (*Frontiers in Human Neuroscience*, 24 studies) confirmed **notable alignment between VR memory assessments and conventional neuropsychological tests**. A meta-analysis by Pieri et al. (2024, *Journal of Intelligence*) found moderate-to-large effect sizes for concurrent validity of VR-based executive function tools against the TMT, Stroop, WCST, and D-KEFS. However, Pieri, Tosi, and Romano's 2023 review in the *Journal of Neuropsychology* cautioned that very few VR assessment tools have achieved complete psychometric standardization, normative data, or clinical readiness. The field shows clear promise but remains pre-clinical for most applications.

### Stroke rehabilitation has the deepest evidence base

VR for post-stroke recovery holds the strongest evidence of any neuropsychological VR application. The **Cochrane Review** (Laver et al., 2025 update) now encompasses **109 trials** and concludes that VR is beneficial for upper limb, lower limb, gait, and balance recovery — particularly when used as an adjunct to conventional therapy rather than a replacement. A 2025 meta-analysis in the *Journal of Clinical Medicine* (23 studies, 395 patients) found significant improvements on the Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity scale (MD = 3.04, p < 0.001), the Wolf Motor Function Test, and the Barthel Index. Semi-immersive VR showed the most consistent motor benefits.

The leading FDA-cleared platforms for stroke rehabilitation are MindMaze's **MindMotionPRO** (hospital inpatient use, can begin as early as 4 days post-stroke) and **MindMotion GO** (portable outpatient/home version), and Penumbra's **REAL System** — though Penumbra **discontinued its Immersive Healthcare division in August 2024**, laying off 71 employees and ending REAL System service by September 30, 2024. Other platforms include **Rehametrics** (CE-marked, 45 VR exercises on Meta Quest), **Motek Medical's CAREN system**, and the **Rehabilitation Gaming System (RGS)**.

### PTSD exposure therapy rivals the gold standard

VR exposure therapy (VRET) for PTSD represents one of the most clinically mature applications in this space. **BRAVEMIND**, developed by Dr. Albert "Skip" Rizzo at USC's Institute for Creative Technologies, has been in development since 2005 and deployed across **170+ clinical sites**, including 28+ VA Medical Centers. It offers 14 virtual combat scenarios with multi-sensory stimulation (3D audio, vibrotactile, olfactory) that clinicians control in real time.

The landmark RCT by Difede, Rothbaum, and Rizzo (2022) — the largest BRAVEMIND trial to date — found VRET **equivalent to Prolonged Exposure (PE)**, the gold-standard PTSD treatment, and **superior for co-morbid major depression**. Seventy-six percent of patients preferred VR to traditional therapy. A broader meta-analysis by Zeng et al. (2025, *Frontiers in Psychiatry*) across 33 RCTs and **3,182 participants** found VR therapy significantly improved anxiety symptoms versus conventional interventions (SMD = −0.95, 95% CI −1.22 to −0.69). The VA Immersive program has now deployed over **1,450 VR headsets across 165+ VA facilities**.

Key commercial platforms for exposure therapy include **Psious** (Spain; phobias, anxiety, OCD, PTSD), **C2Care** (France; phobias, addictions, eating disorders), **Virtually Better** (Atlanta; BRAVEMIND distributor), **PsyTechVR** (AI-driven exposure therapy), and **oVRcome** (New Zealand; consumer-facing phobia treatment).

### Pain management achieved the first major FDA breakthrough

**RelieVRx** by AppliedVR is the field's regulatory flagship. Its 8-week, 56-session VR program delivers CBT skills, diaphragmatic breathing, biofeedback, and mindfulness through daily ~6-minute immersive sessions. The pivotal sham-controlled RCT (Maddox et al., 2023, *Mayo Clinic Proceedings: Digital Medicine*) enrolled **1,067 participants** — one of the largest VR therapeutic trials ever — and demonstrated superiority over sham for both pain intensity and pain interference. A December 2024 secondary analysis found **70% of high-impact chronic pain patients reclassified as lower-impact** post-treatment, with 67% maintaining that status at 12 months. RelieVRx has now reached **60,000+ patients** across 200+ health systems and secured Medicare reimbursement, VA Federal Supply Schedule listing, and the first commercial payer (Highmark) coverage.

CognifiSense's **VRNT** (510(k) K230814, October 2023) takes a different approach, using a personalized digital avatar of the patient's body with pain visualizations to retrain brain pain pathways via neuroplasticity. It explicitly targets prefrontal, somatomotor, and default mode networks, with fMRI data showing functional connectivity changes.

### ADHD assessment shows strong discriminative ability

VR-based ADHD assessment centers on **Nesplora AULA**, the most validated tool in this space. A 2025 systematic review by Di Nardo (*Journal of Advanced Health Care*, 20 studies spanning 2012–2025) confirmed VR tools demonstrate good discriminative ability between ADHD and neurotypical populations and are sensitive to pharmacological treatment effects (e.g., methylphenidate response). A 2024 study used AULA with 110 participants to identify five ADHD clusters via k-means clustering that did not replicate DSM subtypes, suggesting response latency and inhibition better distinguish ADHD subpopulations than traditional categories.

The original **Virtual Classroom** by Rizzo et al. at USC ICT (2006) was the pioneering VR CPT; Adams et al. (2009) found higher classification rates for VR-based CPT versus traditional CPT. An adult-focused tool, the **Virtual Seminar Room (VSR)**, combining CPT with EEG and head tracking, demonstrated feasibility in 2022 (Wiebe et al., *Frontiers in Psychology*).

### TBI recovery and cognitive rehabilitation are emerging frontiers

VR for TBI remains less developed than stroke applications but is accelerating. **EYE-SYNC** (SyncThink/NeuroSync) provides the most mature diagnostic tool — its VR-based eye-tracking platform achieved **>82% sensitivity and >93% specificity** for concussion detection in a 1,655-subject study and holds both 510(k) clearance and FDA Breakthrough Device designation. A 2025 meta-analysis in *Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment* (7 RCTs) found VR interventions significantly improved MoCA scores (MD = 2.41, 95% CI: 1.56–3.26, p < 0.00001) in brain injury patients.

For cognitive rehabilitation more broadly, systematic reviews show VR-based cognitive rehabilitation training is **at least as effective as conventional cognitive rehabilitation** for mild cognitive impairment (Tortora et al., 2024, *Ageing Research Reviews*), while a 2025 review in *npj Digital Medicine* (99 studies) confirmed efficacy across Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and general cognitive impairment. XRHealth's acquisition of **NeuroReality** (now Koji's Quest) in 2024 added dedicated VR cognitive training for stroke, TBI, long COVID, and neurodegenerative conditions to its ecosystem.

## Upgrade VR: a consumer product with limited clinical substance

**Upgrade VR** (Steam App ID 1731880) is a $5.99 VR cognitive training application developed by **Mental Tech LLC** and published by **UPGRADE VR - FZCO**, a Dubai Free Zone Company. It offers daily 10–15 minute sessions across five cognitive domains: memory (item composition/order reproduction), reaction/sensorimotor coordination, spatial orientation, visual tracking (multiple object tracking), and concentration/attention span.

The application claims its games were "developed by neuropsychologists" but **provides no names, credentials, institutional affiliations, or scientific backing**. A Steam Community question asking about the developers' neuropsychological qualifications went unanswered. The product is positioned as a consumer "neurofitness" tool — not a medical device — with marketing language referencing "numerous studies and testimonials" without citing any specific research.

**No published clinical studies, peer-reviewed papers, or independent evaluations of Upgrade VR exist.** The product has extremely low market traction: one total Steam review (insufficient to generate a score), nine Meta Quest ratings, and no Metacritic reviews. Its COVID-19 recovery suggestion ("could be useful as a part of comprehensive recovery") uses appropriately hedged language but lacks any supporting evidence.

In the broader VR cognitive training landscape, Upgrade VR sits at the consumer end of the spectrum — far from the clinical rigor of FDA-cleared tools like RelieVRx or validated assessment platforms like Nesplora. Competitors with stronger evidence bases include **Enhance VR** (Virtuleap, with published research in *Frontiers in Digital Health*), **XRHealth/Koji's Quest** (clinically oriented, Medicare-covered), and **Nesplora Ice Cream** (normed executive function assessment). No connection between Upgrade VR and aidxr.com was found in any public sources.

## The aidxr.com domain is not yet publicly operational

As of this research date, **aidxr.com does not appear to be a live, publicly accessible website**. Attempts to fetch the main page and standard subpages (/about, /products, /services, /team, /contact, /blog) all failed. A `site:aidxr.com` search returned zero indexed results, and no press releases, LinkedIn profiles, social media accounts, regulatory filings, or news coverage reference aidxr.com as an active company. The only existing use of "AidXR" as a brand is an open-source AR first-aid demo project by an individual Indian developer (last active 2019), which is unrelated to any commercial VR healthcare venture. If this is a site currently in development, it enters a market with established players but significant remaining opportunity — particularly in cognitive assessment standardization, TBI-specific tools, and integrated neuropsychological platforms that bridge assessment and rehabilitation.

## Conclusion

VR neuropsychology has evolved from proof-of-concept demonstrations into a regulated clinical field with **FDA-authorized devices, Medicare reimbursement codes, and evidence from thousands of trial participants**. The strongest evidence supports three applications: stroke motor rehabilitation (109 Cochrane-reviewed trials), PTSD exposure therapy (equivalent to Prolonged Exposure in head-to-head RCTs), and chronic pain management (1,067-patient sham-controlled trial). Cognitive assessment tools show compelling ecological validity advantages over traditional neuropsychological batteries, but most lack the psychometric standardization needed for routine clinical adoption.

The regulatory landscape continues to evolve rapidly — the FDA's creation of product code QRA and CMS's E1905 HCPCS code specifically for VR therapeutic devices signals institutional recognition that VR is a legitimate treatment modality, not merely experimental technology. For any company entering this space, the clearest opportunities lie in areas where clinical need outpaces available tools: **standardized VR-based cognitive assessment** (where Nesplora leads but few competitors exist), **TBI-specific rehabilitation** (where evidence lags far behind stroke), and **integrated platforms** that combine assessment and treatment within a single clinically validated ecosystem. The gap between consumer "brain training" products (like Upgrade VR) and clinically validated, FDA-pathway devices remains vast — and commercially, the evidence-based end of that spectrum is where reimbursement, institutional adoption, and defensible market positioning reside.
