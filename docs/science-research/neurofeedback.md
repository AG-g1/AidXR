# VR + Neurofeedback — Peer-Reviewed Research

## Summary

Combining VR with real-time neural monitoring (EEG, BCI) creates a feedback loop that drives measurable neuroplastic changes. Neuroimaging confirms actual structural and functional brain improvements — gray matter increases in the hippocampus and caudate nucleus — following VR-based neurofeedback. 3D VR feedback outperforms traditional 2D screens, and neurofeedback subgroups show the largest effect sizes among game-based ADHD interventions.

## Studies

### 1. Brain Neuroplasticity Leveraging VR and Brain-Computer Interface Technologies

- **Year:** 2024
- **Journal:** Sensors (MDPI)
- **Key Finding:** VR + BCI stimulate specific brain regions, trigger neurochemical changes, and influence cognitive functions. Neuroimaging (fMRI, high-density EEG) confirms neuroplastic changes: significant gray matter increases in hippocampus, caudate nucleus, rostral cingulate zone, central sulcus, and visual cortex. Enhanced neural connectivity and synaptic plasticity.

### 2. VR-Based Feedback for Neurofeedback Training Performance

- **Year:** 2022
- **Journal:** Frontiers in Human Neuroscience
- **Scope:** Sham-controlled study
- **Key Finding:** Participants receiving 3D VR-based feedback showed a linear increase in sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) power over feedback runs within a single session, outperforming traditional 2D feedback approaches.

### 3. Theta/Beta Ratio Neurofeedback for Children with ADHD

- **Year:** 2024
- **Journal:** Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback (Springer)
- **Key Finding:** Within-group effects were medium at post-treatment and large at follow-up. Individualized theta/beta neurofeedback adjusted for alpha activity is more clinically efficient than standard protocols, with lasting effects when combined with EMG training.

## Neuroplastic Changes Documented

Brain changes confirmed by neuroimaging following VR-based neurofeedback:

- **Structural:** Gray matter increases in hippocampus, caudate nucleus, rostral cingulate zone, central sulcus, visual cortex
- **Functional:** Increased EEG concentration (beta waves) in frontopolar and frontal areas; enhanced motor and sensory cortex activity
- **Connectivity:** Synaptic plasticity changes modulating neural circuits for working memory, sensory feedback, motor learning, and cognitive functions

## Safety

A 2024 systematic review found VR is well-tolerated in children ages 4-10 with no noteworthy effects on visuomotor functions or postural stability. VR sickness assessments (headache, eye complaints, dizziness) revealed no or only mild symptoms. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38466416/
