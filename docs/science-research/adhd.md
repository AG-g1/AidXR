## Summary

VR-based interventions significantly improve attention, executive function, and cognitive control in children with ADHD. Immersive VR shows the strongest effects, and neurofeedback subgroups yield the largest effect sizes among game-based interventions.

## Studies

### 1. VR Technology on Attention and Motor Ability in ADHD Children

- **Authors:** Li et al.
- **Year:** 2024
- **Journal:** JMIR Serious Games
- **Scope:** Meta-analysis of 32 studies, 8,139 participants aged 3-19
- **Key Finding:** VR significantly improves attention (Cohen d = -0.68, 95% CI: -1.12 to -0.24; p < .001) and motor ability (Cohen d = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.16-0.80; p < .001). Immersive VR had the strongest attention improvement effect.

### 2. Immersive VR for Improving Cognitive Deficits in Children with ADHD

- **Authors:** Fang et al.
- **Year:** 2023
- **Journal:** Virtual Reality (Springer)
- **Scope:** 7 randomized controlled trials
- **Key Finding:** Large effect sizes for omissions (SMD = -1.38; p = 0.009), correct hits (SMD = -1.50; p = 0.004), moderate for commissions (SMD = -0.62; p = 0.002), and reaction time (SMD = -0.67; p = 0.03). VR most effective at improving sustained attention and vigilance.

### 3. Integrating VR into ADHD Therapy: Advancing Clinical Evidence

- **Year:** 2025
- **Journal:** Frontiers in Psychiatry
- **Key Finding:** VR shows benefits in attention and executive function for individuals with ADHD, with optimal results when combined with pharmacological treatments.

### 4. Game-Based Interventions for Pediatric ADHD: Neurofeedback Meta-Analysis

- **Year:** 2025
- **Journal:** Psychiatry Research
- **Key Finding:** The neurofeedback subgroup showed the largest effect size among all computer game-based interventions for ADHD, with beta band activity enhancement being key to increasing cognitive control.

## FDA Milestone

**EndeavorRx** (Akili Interactive, 2020) — First FDA-authorized prescription video game for ADHD. Five clinical trials with 600+ children. 68% of parents saw clinically meaningful change after two months. Label expanded to ages 8-17 in December 2023.

**EndeavorOTC** (Akili Interactive, 2024) — FDA-cleared OTC for adult ADHD. 83% of 221 participants showed improved attention control on the TOVA.
